# Watch Blog

_Just a simple blog that allows you to create news, edit and delete, in a responsive web made as a code challenge during the interview process for the company [WillDom](https://willdom.com/)_

## Let's Start 🚀

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development purposes._

###  Some Requirements 📋

_The project was made with Rails+React and PostgresSQL, so you need to have installed Nodejs, Yarn, Ruby, the gem bundler and PostgreSQL before the "bundle install" and "yarn install" command. If you dont have installed yet some of then please check this link [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/20.04), that would help you to be ready for coding._

### Install 🔧

_After clone the repo, take a look in your config/database.yml and modify the credential like you have in your local database._


_Then just run_

```
bundle install
```

_after a little while, lets create the database for development purpose_

```
rake db:create

rake db:migrate
```

_The command before just add some initial data for your database, you are free now to go and just run_
```
rails s
```

### Front-End 🔩

_If you want make some changes, go the app/javascript directory, the main file is App.js who is in components/App.js._
